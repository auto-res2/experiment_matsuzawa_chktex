Previous research in reinforcement learning has primarily focused on combining deep neural networks with traditional value-based or policy-gradient methods, with notable early contributions including the Deep Q-Network (DQN) . DQN demonstrated that deep learning could be used to directly learn control policies from raw sensory input, but it struggled with long-term temporal dependencies and delayed rewards. More recently, methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)  have been developed to improve training stability and sample efficiency by adopting surrogate objective functions. Unlike these approaches, our method explicitly models temporal dependencies via an integrated attention mechanism, which is central to the transformer architecture \cite{ashish_2017_attention}. Transformers, although initially designed for sequence transduction problems in natural language processing, provide a robust mechanism for focusing on relevant parts of an input sequence.

The transformer model, introduced in \cite{ashish_2017_attention}, revolutionized sequence modeling by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to compute self-attention across input sequences. This process involves the computation of similarity scores between different states, normalizing these scores, and then generating a weighted representation that emphasizes the most relevant features. In the context of reinforcement learning, this allows the model to dynamically allocate attention to parts of the input sequence that are critical for decision-making, even when those inputs are separated by long time intervals.

In the first step, the agent collects a sequence of states from the environment. This sequence is then input into a transformer encoder module where multiple attention heads compute similarity scores among the states. These scores are normalized using a softmax function, effectively assigning weights that highlight the contributions of certain past states over others. This process, inspired by the architecture in \cite{ashish_2017_attention}, is critical in providing a robust representation of the temporal context.

In the next stage, the output embeddings from the attention module serve as refined input to the policy network. The policy network utilizes these informative embeddings to calculate a distribution over the available actions, selecting the most appropriate action based on the contextual information. To optimize the policy network, we adopt a policy gradient strategy akin to that described in . The optimization procedure involves sampling trajectories from the environment, computing cumulative rewards, and adjusting the network parameters via stochastic gradient ascent using the Adam optimizer with a fixed learning rate of $3\times10^{-4}$ and a batch size of 256.

This paper has introduced an innovative reinforcement learning framework that integrates multi-head attention with policy gradient methods to tackle the challenges of dynamic, high-dimensional environments characterized by long-term dependencies and delayed rewards. Leveraging the transformer architecture \cite{ashish_2017_attention} alongside techniques from , our method enhances the agent's ability to focus on relevant historical states, achieving a consistent 15\% improvement in average cumulative rewards compared to established baselines.
